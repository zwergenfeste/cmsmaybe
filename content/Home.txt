	    <h3>to Users</h3>
	    <p>"All" what CMSMayBe does is ease building a website.</p>
	    <p>CMSMayBe simply displays text from files.</p>
	    <p>With the templates elements are arranged and some styles are added.</p>
	    <p>You only need basic knowledge of HTML in order to use CMSMayBe.</p>
	    <p>There is no publisher or administrator interface to edit pages - Everything is done with add/editing/remove files.</p>
	    <p>To have no admin panel does not mean that a feature is missing - This is how it should be:</p>
	    <ul>
		<li>Simple</li>
		<li>Accessible</li>
		<li>Comprehensible</li>
		<li>Secure</li>
		<li>Fast</li>
	    </ul>

	    <h3>to Developers</h3>
 	    <p>Just do with the code what you want, it is free as in freedom and open source.</p>
	    <p>CMSMayBe does not need a database - it is just files.</p>
	    <p>Templates are plain HTML files with content tags/placeholders.</p>
	    <p>CMSMayBe has its own router and does this REST-thingy.</p>
	    <p>It has a role based authentication system.</p>
	    <p>Something like plugins exist. For maximum flexibility they can be registered in different ways.</p>
